# Remove the duplicates in a vector
two cases are included in question1, 
for the first case which no std::set use, I didn't sort the vector.
But for the second case, std::set automatically sorted the vector.
# Time Complexity
function1 is O(n^2); 
function2 is O(nlogn) because the insert function has a O(logn) time complexity; 
function3 is O(n); 
function4 is O(n);
function5 is O(logn); 
function6 is O(n^2);
